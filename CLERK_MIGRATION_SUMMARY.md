# Clerk Migration Summary

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Core Infrastructure ✅
- **Clerk packages installed**: `@clerk/nextjs` and `@clerk/themes`
- **Environment configuration**: Added Clerk settings to `lib/env.ts`
- **ClerkProvider**: Integrated in `pages/_app.tsx` (alongside NextAuth for gradual migration)
- **Middleware**: Created `middleware.clerk.ts` with route protection and security headers
- **Webhook handler**: Created `pages/api/webhooks/clerk.ts` for syncing users and organizations

### 2. Authentication Helpers ✅
- **Server-side helpers** (`lib/clerk.ts`):
  - `getCurrentUserWithTeam()` - Get user with organization context
  - `hasPermission()` - Check permissions using existing RBAC
  - `requireAuth()` - Ensure authentication
  
- **Session management** (`lib/clerk-session.ts`):
  - `getSession()` - Get session for API routes
  - `getCurrentUserWithTeam()` - Get user with team context for API routes
  - `throwIfNoTeamAccess()` - Verify team access
  - `throwIfNotAllowed()` - Check permissions

### 3. Client-side Integration ✅
- **React hooks** (`hooks/useClerkAuth.ts`):
  - `useClerkAuth()` - Main authentication hook
  - `useRequireAuth()` - Require authentication
  - `useTeamAccess()` - Check team access
  
### 4. Example Implementations ✅
- **API Route**: `pages/api/teams/[slug]/index.clerk.ts` - Shows how to migrate API routes
- **Login Page**: `pages/auth/login.clerk.tsx` - Demonstrates Clerk UI components

## Migration Architecture

### User & Organization Sync
```
Clerk User → Webhook → Database User
Clerk Organization → Webhook → Database Team
Clerk Membership → Webhook → Database TeamMember
```

### Role Mapping
```typescript
CLERK_ROLES = {
  'org:admin': Role.ADMIN,
  'org:member': Role.MEMBER,
  'org:owner': Role.OWNER,
}
```

### Session Flow
1. User authenticates with Clerk
2. Clerk manages session tokens
3. Our helpers fetch user data from database
4. Permissions checked against existing RBAC system

## What Still Needs Migration

### 1. Authentication Methods
- [ ] Configure email/password in Clerk dashboard
- [ ] Set up magic links
- [ ] Configure OAuth (GitHub, Google)
- [ ] Implement SAML SSO
- [ ] Handle IdP-initiated flows

### 2. UI Components
- [ ] Sign up page
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Account settings
- [ ] Team management UI
- [ ] Session management UI

### 3. API Routes
- [ ] All `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- [ ] Protected API routes (gradual migration)
- [ ] Team invitation endpoints
- [ ] Custom signout endpoint

### 4. Database Updates
- [ ] Add Clerk user ID to User model
- [ ] Migration script for existing users
- [ ] Update seed scripts

### 5. Email Integration
- [ ] Welcome emails
- [ ] Team invitations
- [ ] Password reset (if using custom flow)

### 6. Security Features
- [ ] Configure Clerk's attack protection
- [ ] Set up bot protection
- [ ] Configure password policies
- [ ] Session duration settings

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Update unit tests
- [ ] Update E2E tests
- [ ] Test migration scripts

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Operation (Current)
- Both NextAuth and Clerk are active
- New features use Clerk
- Existing features gradually migrated

### Phase 2: Feature Migration
1. Start with low-risk features (read-only endpoints)
2. Migrate authentication UI
3. Migrate write operations
4. Migrate team management

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Remove NextAuth dependencies
2. Clean up old auth code
3. Update all documentation
4. Remove migration helpers

## Configuration Needed in Clerk Dashboard

1. **Authentication Methods**:
   - Enable Email/Password
   - Enable Magic Links
   - Add OAuth providers (GitHub, Google)
   - Configure Enterprise SSO

2. **Organizations**:
   - Enable organizations
   - Set up roles (owner, admin, member)
   - Configure invitation flow

3. **Security**:
   - Set up attack protection
   - Configure session duration
   - Enable bot protection

4. **Webhooks**:
   - Add webhook endpoint: `https://[your-domain]/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - Select events: user.*, organization.*, organizationMembership.*

5. **Customization**:
   - Configure email templates
   - Set up custom domains
   - Customize UI components

## Key Differences to Note

1. **Sessions**: Clerk manages sessions internally, no need for session tables
2. **Roles**: Organization-based roles instead of team-specific roles
3. **API Keys**: Need custom implementation (Clerk doesn't provide API key management)
4. **SAML**: Different implementation approach than SAML Jackson
5. **Account Lockout**: Use Clerk's built-in attack protection

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Configure Clerk dashboard with authentication methods
2. Create user migration script
3. Migrate login and signup pages
4. Start migrating API routes one by one
5. Update tests for migrated features
